# ChatBotToBeValidator
To validate the format of the verb to be with regular expressions
=======

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## Objetive

The program's main function would be to take a user's input, analyze it, and then determine if the sentence is grammatically correct.

Here's the basic workflow:

    1.Receive a sentence: The program must first get a sentence from the user.

    2.Analyze the sentence: It then needs to check for two things:

        Does the sentence contain a form of the verb "to be" (like am, is, are, was, were)?

        If so, is that form of the verb correctly matched with the subject (e.g., "I am" is correct, but "I are" is not).

    3.Provide a result: Based on the analysis, the program should give the user a clear answer. It could say "Correct" if the sentence is valid or "Incorrect" if it's not.
